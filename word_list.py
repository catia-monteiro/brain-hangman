    "cerebrum": "The largest part of the brain, divided into two hemispheres, responsible for higher-level functions "
                "such as conscious thought, memory and sensory processing.",
    "frontal lobe": "Located at the front of the brain, the frontal lobe is responsible for executive functions, "
                    "decision-making and personality.",
    "fusiform gyrus": "A part of the brain involved in facial recognition and perception of color.",
    "hippocampus": "A curved structure within the brain's temporal lobes that plays a crucial role in the formation "
                   "and consolidation of memories.",
    "hypothalamus": "Situated below the thalamus, the hypothalamus regulates various bodily functions, including "
                    "hunger, thirst, body temperature and the sleep-wake cycle.",
    "insula": "A region deep within the cerebral cortex involved in functions related to consciousness, emotion "
              "and perception.",
    "medulla oblongata": "Located at the base of the brainstem, the medulla oblongata controls vital autonomic "
                         "functions such as breathing, heart rate and blood pressure.",
    "midbrain": "A small region of the brainstem involved in sensory processing, movement and arousal.",
    "occipital lobe": "Located at the back of the brain, the occipital lobe is primarily responsible for processing "
                      "visual information from the eyes.",
    "parietal lobe": "Located behind the frontal lobe and above the occipital lobe, the parietal lobe is responsible "
                     "for processing sensory information from various parts of the body, as well as spatial awareness"
                     " and navigation.",
    "pineal gland": "A small endocrine gland located near the center of the brain that secretes melatonin, regulating "
                    "sleep-wake cycles and circadian rhythms.",
    "pituitary gland": "A pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain, often referred to as the 'master gland' "
                       "because it controls the functions of other endocrine glands and regulates growth and "
                       "development.",
    "pons": "Part of the brainstem, the pons serves as a relay center for nerve signals between the cerebrum and "
            "cerebellum, and it also plays a role in controlling sleep and breathing.",

                     "auditory information, language comprehension and memory.",
    "thalamus": "Acts as a relay station for sensory information (except smell) traveling to the cerebral cortex, "
                "helping to regulate consciousness, sleep and alertness.",
    "ventricles": "Fluid-filled cavities within the brain that produce and circulate cerebrospinal fluid, providing "
                  "cushioning and nourishment for the brain."
